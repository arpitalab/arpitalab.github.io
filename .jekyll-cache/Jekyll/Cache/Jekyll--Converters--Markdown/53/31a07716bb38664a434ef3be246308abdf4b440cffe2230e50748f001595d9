Research. What began as an improved photo-bleaching correction for single molecule dynamics in the nucleus
evolved into an exciting new finding! Transcription factors (TF) must engage with chromatin to regulate gene expression. Single-molecule tracking makes it possible to follow individual TF molecules inside nuclei of live cells, where they diffuse and interact with chromatin. Current interpretation of the dwell-times, which are a measure of the interaction times with chromatin invoke a bi-exponential model, with a fast component representing nonspecific interactions with chromatin, while a slower component represents specific binding.</p>

<p>Using this new photobleaching correction, David showed that the bi-exponential model misrepresents the true interaction behavior of TFs. He, along with Diego, showed that transcription factor dwell time distributions are best described by a power-law model. A simple model, modified from the seminal work of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/037015739090099N">Bouchaud and Georges</a>, shows that the observed
power-law distributions emerge as a result of a broad distribution of transcription factor-chromatin interaction affinities.</p>
