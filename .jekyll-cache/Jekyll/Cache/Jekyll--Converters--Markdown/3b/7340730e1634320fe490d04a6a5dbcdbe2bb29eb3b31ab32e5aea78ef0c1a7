I"<p>The molecular and biophysical mechanisms by which the physical environment influences cell fate and behavior are open questions in the field. Beyond the modulation of cellular processes such as cell shape, migration, signaling, cytoskeletal organization and dynamics (which has been our focus), the ultimate consequence of mechanosensing is the modulation of gene expression and changes in cell fate. Forces generated by the cytoskeleton as the cell adapts to mechanical stimuli are transmitted to the nucleus and chromatin via physical links on the nuclear envelope. How cytoskeletal forces affect nuclear dynamics and chromatin accessibility to transcription factors to drive gene expression are not well understood. Also, most insights about gene regulation by mechanical inputs have been gained from bulk analysis of gene expression patterns, which makes it difficult to link how forces generated by individual cells affect chromatin accessibility and transcription factor dynamics driving gene regulation (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33712293/">Wagh et al. 2021</a>). We collaborate with <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/laboratory-of-receptor-biology-and-gene-expression">Dr. Gordon Hager at NIH</a> to use single molecule imaging of transcription factors as they diffuse and bind to cognate response elements on chromatin. We have recently demonstrated that transcription factor binding strengths are scale-free (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33592625/">Garica et al. 2021a</a>) and intrinsic disordered regions on transcription factors alter their diffusion and transcriptional efficacy (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33561389/">Garcia et al. 2021b</a>). We are currently studying how transcription factor dynamics and gene expression are altered by substrate stiffness.</p>
