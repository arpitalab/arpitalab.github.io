      David’s paper on transcription factor dynamics is published as a “Breakthrough Article” in Nucleic Acids Research. What began as an improved photo-bleaching correction for single molecule dynamics in the nucleus evolved into an exciting new finding!

      Taking advantage of the crisp and wonderful Fall weather for masked lab hikes! Met up at Centennial
Park near Ellicott City, MD. It was the first time we saw each other since the beginning of the
pandemic and lab shutdowns.
