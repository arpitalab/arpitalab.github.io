<p>David gave a fantastic talk in a successful defense of his PhD thesis! The second student from the
lab to have defended virtually â€“ it was very well attended
and a bonus to have his family, friends and collaborators join from afar. No cake and
champagne but we got together for a virtual lab happy hour!
It was the culmination of years of work in an exciting new area we started a collaboration
on with the Hager lab at NIH, with two recent publications!
in <a href="http://markdowntutorial.com/">Nucleic Acids Research</a>
