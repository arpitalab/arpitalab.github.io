        The research in our lab broadly pursues two themes: (1) How cellular force generation and force response influence biochemical signaling within the cell, with particular emphasis on the immune response (2) How information about the physical environment is translated into gene expression. In order to answer these  questions, we use state of the art imaging for the visualization of internal protein dynamics at high spatial and temporal resolution, traction force microscopy for measurements of cellular forces simultaneously with signaling, single molecule and high-throughput genomics to measure gene expression, 
				and genetic and physical tools to perturb the system.

		<h3>Physical aspects of immune cell signaling</h3>
		<p>
			The interplay of physical forces and biochemical signaling pathways is critical in driving many biological phenomena including the immune response. T cells, which are central players in the immune response, bind to antigen presenting cells through specialized receptor-ligand interactions. Receptor engagement initiates actin dynamics which leads to deformation of the cell membrane and spatial patterning of signaling proteins into micro-clusters which are essential for signaling. We aim to understand the physical mechanisms governing contact formation between immune cells, signaling and spatial organization of signaling proteins.

    	<h5>Cytoskeletal dynamics and signaling in T cells</h5>
    	<p>
    		T cell activation by antigen-presenting cells involves extensive changes in the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. Cytoskeletal dynamics lead to the reorganization of receptors and signaling molecules into dynamic microclusters within the T cell/antigen-presenting cell interface. We use live cell and super-resolution imaging combined with quantitative image analysis and biophysical models to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that link T cell signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics. We have recently demonstrated that dynamic microtubules regulate actin assembly with the interface (Hui and Upadhyaya, 2017, Rey-Suarez et al. 2020). We are now developing methods to optogenetically perturb T cell actin dynamics to dissect the signaling pathways that control cytoskeletal dynamics during this process.

    	<h5>Force generation in T cells</h5>
    	<p>
    		A number of studies have shown that signaling by single and ensembles of T/B cell receptors are sensitive to externally applied forces. However, in the body, these forces have to be generated by the cell itself. The magnitude, spatial organization and temporal properties of internal cytoskeletal forces and whether they are sufficient to engage signaling were not known. We have shown that while T cells are weak force generators, the forces are sufficient to facilitate receptor activation, and that the forces are largely generated and maintained by the dynamics of the acto-myosin cytoskeleton (Hui et al. 2014).These measurements demonstrate that physiological level of forces are sufficient for biochemical activation of signaling receptors. More recently we have shown a surprising and hitherto unknown role for microtubule filament dynamics in T cell force generation (Hui and Upadhyaya, 2017), and that the interaction between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons is essential for optimum force balance in cells. Given the importance of dynamic force application in T cell activation, we have examined the statistics of force fluctuations during signaling. We found that cytoskeletal forces showed clear non-equilibrium character, indicative of active forcing, with a 1/f<sup>2</sup> power spectrum. Using super-resolution imaging methods (instant Structured Illumination Microscopy), we found that these two spatially distinct regimes of force generation arise from different actin-based structures that have distinct molecular origins. We are currently studying the biophysical and molecular mechanisms that determine the forces generated during T cell activation and how these couple to signaling and function.

    <h5>Immune receptor dynamics</h5>
    <p>
    		Cellular processes are often governed by molecular interactions or events, such as binding of cell surface receptors to extracellular ligand. These molecular scale events lead to cooperative behavior at the mesoscale such as aggregation into macromolecular complexes and emergence of larger scale cellular responses. How these different scales are linked is an open question in the field. Mobility of single cell surface molecules can provide insight into their biochemical state, the physical properties of their microenvironment and the forces acting on them. Our work has shown that lateral mobility of ligands is an important parameter regulating microcluster formation and signaling threshold (Ketchum et al. 2014). A recent goal of our lab has been to dissect the biochemical interactions and evolution of signaling states. We have established imaging techniques to quantify movement of single B cell receptors with high spatial and temporal resolution. In collaboration with Simon Mochrie (Yale Univ.), we have used machine-learning methods to reveal the diffusive states populated by BCR and map these states onto BCR signaling states. We have shown that actin regulatory proteins (WASP and NWASP) modulate these diffusive and signaling states, indicating that actin based forces are important in driving receptor mobility, which in turn determines clustering and the biochemical response of B cells. Together, these studies along with our ongoing collaborative work with Dr. Wenxia Song demonstrate that forces from actin polymerization directly receptor movement, in addition to acting as diffusion barriers for BCR movement and underscores the importance of cytoskeletal forces in signaling. We are now developing analysis and imaging methods to study how active fluctuations drive B cell receptor movement and clustering.

		<h3>Cellular mechanosensing</h3>
		<p>
			Physical properties of the extracellular environment can have profound influence on cell behavior in various physiological processes such as development, cell fate determination, the immune response and cancer metastases. For instance, substrate rigidity serves as a master regulator in the body to control cellular functions from cytoskeletal dynamics to gene expression. However, the mechanism by which cells sense and respond to the stiffness is an outstanding question in the field. Over the past four years, we have established a variety of experimental methods and collaborations with theorists to examine the cellular basis of mechanosensing.

    	<h5>Sensing substrate stiffness</h5>
    	<p>
			While many cells show the ability to adapt to the mechanical properties of their surroundings, the mechanisms underlying the origins of mechanosensitivity are not known, but likely involve adaptive changes in the organization and mechanical properties of the actin cytoskeleton with subsequent changes in cell compliance and shape. Conceptually, we imagine the cell as an idealized stiffness-measuring device: during a measurement, the device exerts a local force on the substrate and reads out a local elastic modulus. How this device is realized by the structural and biochemical readout available to the cell and how it affects cell remains to be determined. Although efforts have been made in this direction in various cellular contexts, how stiffness influences immune cell function has largely been unexplored until recently. We demonstrated that T cells are mechanosensitive, altering their signaling dynamics and forces generated in response to substrate stiffness. We found that forces increase monotonically with stiffness of the external surface indicating that cells reorganize their cytoskeletal machinery adaptively. A model from active matter theory is able to explain this behavior based on cellular adaptation to substrate rigidity resulting from interplay between passive elasticity and active contractility.

				The molecular and biophysical mechanisms by which the physical environment influences cell fate and behavior are open questions in the field. Beyond the modulation of cellular processes such as cell shape, migration, signaling, cytoskeletal organization and dynamics (which has been our focus), the ultimate consequence of mechanosensing is the modulation of gene expression and changes in cell fate. Forces generated by the cytoskeleton as the cell adapts to mechanical stimuli are (thought to be) transmitted to the nucleus and chromatin via physical links on the nuclear envelope. How cytoskeletal forces affect nuclear dynamics and chromatin accessibility to transcription factors to drive gene expression are not well understood. Also, most insights about gene regulation by mechanical inputs have been gained from bulk analysis of gene expression patterns, which makes it difficult to link how forces generated by individual cells affect chromatin accessibility and transcription factor dynamics driving gene regulation. We have recently established collaboration with Dr. Gordon Hager (NIH) to pursue these questions and bring novel insight by combining our expertise in the fields of biophysics of force generation and biology of the regulation of gene expression.
