I"I<p>After graduating with a degree in Engineering Physics from IIT Madras, Kaustabh concluded that he liked physics more than engineering and joined the Physics PhD program at Maryland. As a graduate student, his work focuses on understanding the interplay between the cytoskeleton and early signaling in immune cells. In particular, he is interested in the role of adapter proteins linking the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons in mechanosensation and T cell signaling. When he is not working, Kaustubh enjoys baking and sharing random bits of trivia with anyone within earshot.</p>
