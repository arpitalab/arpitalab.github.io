I"@<p>Omni-ATAC is a carefully optimized ATAC-seq method that provides improvements on data quality, cost, and generalizability. It works on every cell type that we have tested, from cell lines to flash frozen tissues. The original protocol can be found as <a href="/pdfs/OmniATAC_Protocol.pdf">Supplementary Protocol 1</a> of Corces et al. Nature Methods 2017 and an <strong>updated protocol for nuclei isolation from frozen tissue</strong> can be found <a href="https://www.protocols.io/view/isolation-of-nuclei-from-frozen-tissue-for-atac-se-6t8herw">on protocols.io</a>.</p>
