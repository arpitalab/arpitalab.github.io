I"˜<p>Cellular processes are often governed by molecular interactions or events, such as binding of cell surface receptors to extracellular ligand. These molecular scale events lead to cooperative behavior at the mesoscale such as aggregation into macromolecular complexes and emergence of larger scale cellular responses. How these different scales are linked is an open question. Mobility of single cell surface molecules can provide insight into their biochemical state, the physical properties of their microenvironment and the forces acting on them. Our work has shown that lateral mobility of ligands is an important parameter regulating microcluster formation and signaling threshold in B lymphocytes (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24411234/">Ketchum et al. 2014</a>). A recent goal of our lab has been to dissect the biochemical interactions and evolution of signaling states.
We have established imaging techniques to quantify movement of single B cell receptors with high spatial and temporal resolution. In collaboration with Simon Mochrie (Yale Univ.), we have used machine-learning methods to reveal the diffusive states populated by BCR and map these states onto BCR signaling states. We have shown that actin regulatory proteins (WASP and NWASP) modulate these diffusive and signaling states, indicating that actin based forces are important in driving receptor mobility, which in turn determines clustering and the biochemical response of B cells (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31974357/">Rey-Suarez et al. 2020</a>). We are now developing analysis and imaging methods to study how active fluctuations drive B cell receptor movement and clustering.</p>
