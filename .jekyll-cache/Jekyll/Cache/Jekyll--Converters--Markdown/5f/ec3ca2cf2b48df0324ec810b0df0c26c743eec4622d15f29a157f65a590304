I"—<p>A number of studies have shown that signaling by single and ensembles of T/B cell receptors are sensitive to externally applied forces. However, in the body, these forces have to be generated by the cell itself. The magnitude, spatial organization and temporal properties of internal cytoskeletal forces and whether they are sufficient to engage signaling were not known. We have shown that while T cells are weak force generators, the forces are sufficient to facilitate receptor activation, and that the forces are largely generated and maintained by the dynamics of the acto-myosin cytoskeleton (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25518938/">Hui et al. 2014</a>). These measurements demonstrate that physiological level of forces are sufficient for biochemical activation of signaling receptors.
More recently we have shown a surprising and hitherto unknown role for microtubule filament dynamics in T cell force generation (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28490501/">Hui and Upadhyaya, 2017</a>), and that the interaction between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons is essential for optimum force balance in cells. Our ongoing work explores the biophysical mechanisms of force generation in T cells, its molecular regulation and functional impact. We are currently interested in understanding how cytokine signaling regulates cellular force generation in cytotoxic T cells and how this regulation affects their cytotoxic potential. Given the importance of dynamic force application in T cell activation, we are also interested in quantifying the statistics of force fluctuations during signaling and how they arise from  active forcing by the cytoskeleton.</p>
