I"<p>T cell activation by antigen-presenting cells involves extensive changes in the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. Cytoskeletal dynamics lead to the reorganization of receptors and signaling molecules into dynamic microclusters within the T cell/antigen-presenting cell interface. We use live cell and super-resolution imaging combined with quantitative image analysis and biophysical models to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that link T cell signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics. We have recently demonstrated that dynamic microtubules regulate actin assembly with the interface (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28490501/">Hui and Upadhyaya, 2017</a>). We use super-resolution imaging methods (e.g. instant Structured Illumination Microscopy, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.nibib.nih.gov/labs-at-nibib/high-resolution-optical-imaging-hroi">Dr. Hari Shroff at NIBIB</a>) and quantitative image analysis to uncover the molecular basis of the crosstalk between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons during T cell activation (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33826369/">Rey-Suarez et al. 2021</a>). We are also developing methods to optogenetically perturb T cell actin dynamics to dissect the signaling pathways that control cytoskeletal dynamics during this process.</p>
