# Welcome to the Upadhyaya Lab!

We are part of the [Department of Physics](http://umdphysics.umd.edu/) 
at the [University of Maryland](http://www.umd.edu/).

Our laboratory aims to understand how cellular mechanics and cytoskeleta forces enable a cell to sense and respond to its physical environment. We are particularly interested in the regulation of the biochemical signaling function in cells during the immune response, cancer and development. We combine quantitative imaging, computational analysis and approaches from soft condensed matter with genetic manipulation and modern cell biology to uncover how cellular forces are linked with signal transduction.
