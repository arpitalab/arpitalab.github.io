        <h3>Postdoctoral position</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="text-justify">We are looking for Postdoctoral Research Associate to investigate chromatin and transcription factor dynamics using single-molecule imaging, biophysical, and molecular biology approaches. This position is supported for up to five years by an NIGMS MIRA award to Arpita. The project aims to uncover how factors in the cellular microenvironment regulate chromatin accessibility and transcription factor mobility, organization and binding in cancer and immune cells. We work in close collaboration with the <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/laboratory-of-receptor-biology-and-gene-expression">Hager laboratory at the NIH</a>.

        The candidate will have the freedom to design their project within the broad outlines of the labâ€™s interest areas and will be responsible for the day-to-day running of the project. The Upadhyaya lab is an open and inclusive environment and is dedicated to the career development of scientists, whether they wish to remain in academia or not.

        Applicants should possess (or be close to obtaining) a PhD in Physics, Biophysics, Biochemistry, Cell/Molecular Biology, Cellular Immunology or a related field. Familiarity with biochemical and biophysical approaches to study DNA-protein interactions and/or imaging to study cell and protein dynamics would be desirable. Experience with programming and image data analysis in MATLAB or Python is a plus. Interested individuals should email a cover letter, a description of past research and future goals and their CV to <a href="mailto:arpitau@umd.edu">Arpita</a>.
