  description: 'After graduating with a degree in Engineering Physics from IIT Madras, Kaustabh concluded that he liked physics
    more than engineering and joined the Physics PhD program at Maryland. As a graduate student, his work focuses on understanding
    the interplay between the cytoskeleton and early signaling in immune cells. In particular, he is interested in the role of adapter
    proteins linking the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons in mechanosensation and T cell signaling. When he is not working, Kaustubh
    enjoys baking and sharing random bits of trivia with anyone within earshot. Kaustubh is a postdoctoral fellow in the Laboratory for
    Receptor Biology and Gene Expression at NCI/NIH.'

    on Biomedical Sciences both at Universidad de Los Andes in Bogota. Ivan joined the Biophysics PhD program at
    University of Maryland in the fall of 2013 and joined our lab a year after.
    His main research interest is how the self-assembly and dynamic structure of cytoskeletal filaments allow cells
    to change shape and regulate many processes. In his free time, Ivan enjoys exploring the forests and jungles
    in search of animals to capture with his camera. Ivan is currently a Research Associate at UniAndes in Bogota.'
