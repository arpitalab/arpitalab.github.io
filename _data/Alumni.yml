								Associate at Upadhyaya Lab, he worked on mechanosensation in T cell activation
								including cytoskeletal regulation of traction forces and early signaling as well as
								mechanoregulation of T cell â€“ cancer cell functional interactions. When he is not doing research,
								Altug enjoys spending time with his family and friends, creating all sorts of computer graphics
								and spilling his love for Star Trek at every occasion. Altug is back in Turkey, where is an Assistant Professor in Mechanical Engineering
