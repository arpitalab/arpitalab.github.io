  description: 'After graduating with B.S. and M.S. in Physics from IISER Mohali, India and spending two years as post masters project student with Sabyasachi Rakshit, he joined the Biophysics PhD Program at
  University of Maryland and the Upadhyaya lab shortly after. His primary research interest lies in correlating the mechanical cues to cytoskeletal dynamics and
  biochemical signaling. When he is not working, he likes to play badminton, go traveling or hiking along trails and try cooking new recipes.'

  description: 'Originally from Ann Arbor, Michigan, Frank graduated from Yale University in 2019 with a B.S. in Physics.
  He then spent two years as a postbac research assistant at the University of Michigan under the guidance of Sarah Veatch.
  Frank joined the UMD Biophysics PhD program in the fall of 2021 and the Upadhyaya lab a few months later. His primary research interests
  lie in understanding the dynamics of cytoskeletal networks and in single molecule biophysics generally. Outside the lab, he most enjoys
  engaging himself in a good novel, particularly in the fantasy and science fiction genres.'
