  description: 'Arpita was an undergraduate at Birla Institute of Technology and Science and obtained her Ph.D. in Physics from the University of
  Notre Dame with James Glazier. She was then a postdoctoral fellow and a Pappalardo Fellow at MIT working with Alexander Oudenaarden. Arpita joined University
  of Maryland in 2006 with a joint appointment in [Physics](http://umdphysics.umd.edu) and [Institute for Physical Science and Technology](http://www.ipst.umd.edu). 
  In her (non-existent) spare time, Arpita is an avid photographer and loves hiking.'

  description: 'Ivan is from Villavicencio, Colombia. He studied Physics and then obtained a Masters degree
  on Biomedical Sciences both at Universidad de Los Andes in Bogota. Ivan joined the Biophysics PhD program at
  University of Maryland in the fall of 2013 and joined our lab a year after.
  His main research interest is how the self-assembly and dynamic structure of cytoskeletal filaments allow cells
  to change shape and regulate many processes. In his free time, Ivan enjoys exploring the forests and jungles
  in search of animals to capture with his camera.'

  description: 'After graduating with a degree in Engineering Physics from IIT Madras, Kaustabh concluded that he liked physics
  more than engineering and joined the Physics PhD program at Maryland. As a graduate student, his work focuses on understanding
  the interplay between the cytoskeleton and early signaling in immune cells. In particular, he is interested in the role of adapter
  proteins linking the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons in mechanosensation and T cell signaling. When he is not working, Kaustubh
  enjoys baking and sharing random bits of trivia with anyone within earshot.'
