  description: "Mike's longstanding research interest lies in understanding how proteins function by dynamically interconverting between different conformational states. \
                He was introduced to structural biology and X-ray crystallography an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, \
                where he worked as a research assistant in [Tom Alber](http://fraserlab.com/2014/04/04/Tom-Alber/)’s laboratory. In 2014, he received \
                his Ph.D. in [Biochemistry and Molecular Biology](https://bmsb.chem.ucla.edu/) from UCLA under the direction of [Todd Yeates](http://yeateslab.mbi.ucla.edu/). As a graduate student, \
                Mike investigated the role of conformational polymorphism in expanding the functional diversity of a \
                key family of proteins that define a widespread class of prokaryotic organelles collectively known as “bacterial microcompartments.” \
                As a postdoc in the Fraser Lab, he is developing new methodologies for characterizing protein conformational landscapes, \
                and applying them to understand how those landscapes are altered by mutations and interactions with other molecules. \
                The long-term goal of this work is to deepen our understanding of how genetic mutations lead to human diseases, \
                and to create new opportunities for drug discovery and protein engineering.


                Since joining the Fraser lab in 2014, Mike has been supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the [BioXFEL Science and Technology Center](https://www.bioxfel.org/) (NSF), \
                a Kirschstein NRSA (F32) fellowship from [NIH/NHLBI](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/), and an Independent Postdoctoral Research Award from the [UCSF Program in Breakthrough Biomedical Research (PBBR)](https://pbbr.ucsf.edu/)."
