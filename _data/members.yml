  description: "Altug Ozcelikkale received his PhD from Purdue University, School of Mechanical Engineering while\ 
												working on freezing-induced biotransport phenomena in cells and tissues. As a Post-Doctoral Research\ 
												Associate at Upadhyaya Lab, he is currently interested in mechanosensation in T cell activation\ 
												including cytoskeletal regulation of traction forces and early signaling as well as\ 
												mechanoregulation of T cell – cancer cell functional interactions. When he is not doing research,\
												Altug enjoys spending time with his family and friends, creating all sorts of computer graphics\
												and spilling his love for Star Trek at every occasion."

  description: "Brittany graduated from University of Maryland with a B.S. in Neurobiology and Physiology and
												minors in Physics and Astronomy. Her work in the lab focuses on two projects. The first explores
												the effects of nanotopography on the dynamics and organization of cytoskeletal components during
												T cell activation. Her second project researches mechanisms that link microtubules to cell
												contractility and cytoskeletal reorganization. She also acts as our lab manager and makes all her
												coworkers take the stairs. Brittany is planning to apply to graduate programs in the fall and wants
												to use a biophysical approach to study neurodegenerative diseases. Outside of the lab Brittany
												enjoys tending to her many plants, meeting new cats and encouraging her friends and family's
												sustainability efforts."

  position: Graduate Student
  email: djohnlee (at) fraserlab.com
  description: "After graduating with a degree in Engineering Physics from IIT Madras, Kaustubh concluded that he liked physics more than engineering and joined the Physics PhD program at Maryland. As a graduate student, his work focuses on understanding the interplay between the cytoskeleton and early signaling in immune cells. In particular, he is interested in the role of adapter proteins linking the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons in mechanosensation and T cell signaling. When he isn't working, Kaustubh enjoys baking and sharing random bits of trivia with anyone within earshot."

  description: "Ivan is from Villavicencio, Colombia. He studied Physics and then obtained a master’s degree on Biomedical Sciences both at Universidad de Los Andes in Bogota. Ivan joined the Biophysics PhD program at University of Maryland in the fall of 2013 and joined our lab a year after. Ivan’s main research interest is how the self-assembly and dynamic structure of cytoskeletal filaments allow cells to change shape and regulate many processes. On his free time, Ivan enjoys exploring the forests and jungles in search of animals to capture with his camera."
