  description: 'T cell activation by antigen-presenting cells involves extensive changes
  in the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. Cytoskeletal dynamics lead to the reorganization
  of receptors and signaling molecules into dynamic microclusters within the T cell/antigen-presenting
  cell interface. We use live cell and super-resolution imaging combined with quantitative image
  analysis and biophysical models to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that link T cell signaling
  and cytoskeletal dynamics. We have recently demonstrated that dynamic microtubules regulate actin
  assembly with the interface ([Hui and Upadhyaya, 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28490501/)). We use super-resolution imaging methods
  (e.g. instant Structured Illumination Microscopy, in collaboration with [Dr. Hari Shroff at NIBIB](https://www.nibib.nih.gov/labs-at-nibib/high-resolution-optical-imaging-hroi)) and quantitative image analysis to uncover the molecular basis of the crosstalk between the actin and microtubule
  cytoskeletons during T cell activation ([Rey-Suarez et al. 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33826369/)). We are also developing methods to optogenetically perturb
  T cell actin dynamics to dissect the signaling pathways that control cytoskeletal dynamics during this process. We work in collaboration with the [Papoian group at UMD](http://papoian.chem.umd.edu/) to develop active matter based models of cytoskeletal dynamics to gain a biophysical understanding of the origins and functional implications of these processes.'

  description: ' Cellular processes are often governed by molecular interactions or events, such
  as binding of cell surface receptors to extracellular ligand. These molecular scale events lead
  to cooperative behavior at the mesoscale such as aggregation into macromolecular complexes and
  emergence of larger scale cellular responses.
  How these different scales are linked is an open question. Mobility of single cell
  surface molecules can provide insight into their biochemical state, the physical properties of
  their microenvironment and the forces acting on them. Our work has shown that lateral mobility of
  ligands is an important parameter regulating microcluster formation and signaling threshold in B lymphocytes
  ([Ketchum et al. 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24411234/)). A recent goal of our lab has been to dissect the biochemical interactions
  and evolution of signaling states.

  We have established imaging techniques to quantify movement of
  single B cell receptors with high spatial and temporal resolution. In collaboration with Simon
  Mochrie (Yale Univ.), we have used machine-learning methods to reveal the diffusive states
  populated by BCR and map these states onto BCR signaling states. We have shown that actin
  regulatory proteins (WASP and NWASP) modulate these diffusive and signaling states, indicating
  that actin based forces are important in driving receptor mobility, which in turn determines
  clustering and the biochemical response of B cells ([Rey-Suarez et al. 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31974357/)). We are now developing analysis and imaging methods
  to study how active fluctuations drive B cell receptor movement and clustering. '

  description: 'A number of studies have shown that signaling by single and ensembles of T/B cell
  receptors are sensitive to externally applied forces. However, in the body, these forces have to
  be generated by the cell itself. The magnitude, spatial organization and temporal properties of
  internal cytoskeletal forces and whether they are sufficient to engage signaling were not known.
  We have shown that while T cells are weak force generators, the forces are sufficient to facilitate
  receptor activation, and that the forces are largely generated and maintained by the dynamics of the
  acto-myosin cytoskeleton ([Hui et al. 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25518938/)). These measurements demonstrate that physiological level of
  forces are sufficient for biochemical activation of signaling receptors.

  More recently we have shown a
  surprising and hitherto unknown role for microtubule filament dynamics in T cell force generation
  ([Hui and Upadhyaya, 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28490501/)), and that the interaction between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons
  is essential for optimum force balance in cells. Our ongoing work explores the biophysical mechanisms of force generation in T cells, its molecular regulation and
  functional impact. We are currently interested in understanding how cytokine signaling regulates cellular force
  generation in cytotoxic T cells and how this regulation affects their cytotoxic potential. Given the importance of dynamic force application in
  T cell activation, we are also interested in quantifying the statistics of force fluctuations during signaling and how they arise from  active forcing by
  the cytoskeleton.'

  description: 'The molecular and biophysical mechanisms by which the physical environment
  influences cell fate and behavior are open questions in the field. Beyond the modulation of
  cellular processes such as cell shape, migration, signaling, cytoskeletal organization and
  dynamics (which has been our focus), the ultimate consequence of mechanosensing is the
  modulation of gene expression and changes in cell fate. Forces generated by the cytoskeleton
  as the cell adapts to mechanical stimuli are transmitted to the nucleus and
  chromatin via physical links on the nuclear envelope. How cytoskeletal forces affect nuclear
  dynamics and chromatin accessibility to transcription factors to drive gene expression are not
  well understood. Also, most insights about gene regulation by mechanical inputs have been gained
  from bulk analysis of gene expression patterns, which makes it difficult to link how forces
  generated by individual cells affect chromatin accessibility and transcription factor dynamics
  driving gene regulation ([Wagh et al. 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33712293/)). We collaborate with [Dr. Gordon Hager at NIH](https://ccr.cancer.gov/laboratory-of-receptor-biology-and-gene-expression)
  to use single molecule imaging of transcription factors as they diffuse and bind to cognate response elements
  on chromatin. We have recently demonstrated that transcription factor binding strengths are scale-free
  ([Garica et al. 2021a](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33592625/)) and intrinsic disordered regions on transcription factors alter their diffusion
  and transcriptional efficacy ([Garcia et al. 2021b](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33561389/)). We are currently studying how transcription factor
  dynamics and gene expression are altered by substrate stiffness.'
