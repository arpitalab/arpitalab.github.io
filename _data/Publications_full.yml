  description: 'Mechanotransduction is the ability of a cell to sense mechanical cues from its microenvironment and convert them into biochemical signals to elicit adaptive transcriptional and other cellular responses. Here, we describe recent advances in the field of mechanical regulation of transcription, highlight mechanical regulation of the epigenome as a key novel aspect of mechanotransduction, and describe recent technological advances that could further elucidate the link between mechanical stimuli and gene expression. In this review, we emphasize the importance of mechanotransduction as one of the governing principles of cancer progression, underscoring the need to conduct further studies of the molecular mechanisms involved in sensing mechanical cues and coordinating transcriptional responses.'

  description: 'Single-molecule tracking (SMT) allows the study of transcription factor (TF) dynamics in the nucleus, giving important information regarding the diffusion and binding behavior of these proteins in the nuclear environment. Dwell time distributions obtained by SMT for most TFs appear to follow bi-exponential behavior. This has been ascribed to two discrete populations of TFs—one non-specifically bound to chromatin and another specifically bound to target sites, as implied by decades of biochemical studies. However, emerging studies suggest alternate models for dwell-time distributions, indicating the existence of more than two populations of TFs (multi-exponential distribution), or even the absence of discrete states altogether (power-law distribution). Here, we present an analytical pipeline to evaluate which model best explains SMT data. We find that a broad spectrum of TFs (including glucocorticoid receptor, oestrogen receptor, FOXA1, CTCF) follow a power-law distribution of dwell-times, blurring the temporal line between non-specific and specific binding, suggesting that productive binding may involve longer binding events than previously believed. From these observations, we propose a continuum of affinities model to explain TF dynamics, that is consistent with complex interactions of TFs with multiple nuclear domains as well as binding and searching on the chromatin template.'

  description: 'Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by binding to specific consensus motifs within the local chromatin context. The mechanisms by which TFs navigate the nuclear environment as they search for binding sites remain unclear. Here, we used single-molecule tracking and machine-learning-based classification to directly measure the nuclear mobility of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in live cells. We revealed two distinct and dynamic low-mobility populations. One accounts for specific binding to chromatin, while the other represents a confinement state that requires an intrinsically disordered region (IDR), implicated in liquid-liquid condensate subdomains. Further analysis showed that the dwell times of both subpopulations follow a power-law distribution, consistent with a broad distribution of affinities on the GR cistrome and interactome. Together, our data link IDRs with a confinement state that is functionally distinct from specific chromatin binding and modulates the transcriptional output by increasing the local concentration of TFs at specific sites.'

  description: 'Regulation of membrane receptor mobility tunes cellular response to external signals, such as in binding of B cell receptors (BCR) to antigen, which initiates signaling. However, whether BCR signaling is regulated by BCR mobility, and what factors mediate this regulation, are not well understood. Here we use single molecule imaging to examine BCR movement during signaling activation and a novel machine learning method to classify BCR trajectories into distinct diffusive states. Inhibition of actin dynamics downstream of the actin nucleating factors, Arp2/3 and formin, decreases BCR mobility. Constitutive loss or acute inhibition of the Arp2/3 regulator, N-WASP, which is associated with enhanced signaling, increases the proportion of BCR trajectories with lower diffusivity. Furthermore, loss of N-WASP reduces the diffusivity of CD19, a stimulatory co-receptor, but not that of FcγRIIB, an inhibitory co-receptor. Our results implicate a dynamic actin network in fine-tuning receptor mobility and receptor-ligand interactions for modulating B cell signaling.'

  description: 'T-cell receptor (TCR) triggering and subsequent T-cell activation are essential for the adaptive immune response. Recently, multiple lines of evidence have shown that force transduction across the TCR complex is involved during TCR triggering, and that the T cell might use its force-generation machinery to probe the mechanical properties of the opposing antigen-presenting cell, giving rise to different signaling and physiological responses. Mechanistically, actin polymerization and turnover have been shown to be essential for force generation by T cells, but how these actin dynamics are regulated spatiotemporally remains poorly understood. Here, we report that traction forces generated by T cells are regulated by dynamic microtubules (MTs) at the interface. These MTs suppress Rho activation, nonmuscle myosin II bipolar filament assembly, and actin retrograde flow at the T-cell-substrate interface. Our results suggest a novel role of the MT cytoskeleton in regulating force generation during T-cell activation.'

  description: 'B-cell signaling activation is most effectively triggered by the binding of B-cell receptors (BCRs) to membrane-bound antigens. In vivo, B-cells encounter antigen on antigen-presenting cells (APC), which possess complex surfaces with convoluted topographies, a fluid membrane and deformable cell bodies. However, whether and how the physical properties of antigen presentation affect B-cell activation is not well understood. Here we use nanotopographic surfaces that allow systematic variation of geometric parameters to show that surface features on a subcellular scale influence B-cell signaling and actin dynamics. Parallel nanoridges with spacings of 3 microns or greater induce actin intensity oscillations on the ventral cell surface. Nanotopography-induced actin dynamics requires BCR signaling, actin polymerization, and myosin contractility. The topography of the stimulatory surface also modulates the distribution of BCR clusters in activated B-cells. Finally, B-cells stimulated on nanopatterned surfaces exhibit intracellular calcium oscillations with frequencies that depend on topography. Our results point to the importance of physical aspects of ligand presentation, in particular, nanotopography for B-cell activation and antigen gathering.'

  description: 'T cell responses to antigen are initiated by engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR)1, leading to activation of diverse signaling cascades, including an incompletely defined pathway that triggers rapid remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. Defects in the control of actin dynamics and organization are associated with several human immunodeficiency diseases, emphasizing the importance of cytoskeletal remodeling in the functioning of the adaptive immune system. Here, we investigate the role of the adaptor protein Bcl102 in the control of actin dynamics. Although Bcl10 is primarily known as a component of the pathway connecting the TCR to activation of the NF-κB3 transcription factor, a few studies have implicated Bcl10 in antigen receptor-dependent control of actin polymerization and F-actin-dependent functional responses. However, the role of Bcl10 in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics remains largely undefined. To investigate the contribution of Bcl10 in the regulation of TCR-dependent cytoskeletal dynamics, we monitored actin dynamics at the immune synapse of primary murine CD8 effector T cells. Quantification of these dynamics reveals two distinct temporal phases distinguished by differences in speed and directionality. Our results indicate that effector CD8 T cells lacking Bcl10 display faster actin flows and more dynamic lamellipodia, compared to wild-type cells. These studies define a role for Bcl10 in TCR-dependent actin dynamics, emphasizing that Bcl10 has important cytoskeleton-directed functions that are likely independent of its role in transmission of NF-κB -activating signals.'

  description: 'Genes are transcribed in a discontinuous pattern referred to as RNA bursting, but the mechanisms regulating this process are unclear. Although many physiological signals, including glucocorticoid hormones, are pulsatile, the effects of transient stimulation on bursting are unknown. Here we characterize RNA synthesis from single-copy glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-regulated transcription sites (TSs) under pulsed (ultradian) and constant hormone stimulation. In contrast to constant stimulation, pulsed stimulation induces restricted bursting centered around the hormonal pulse. Moreover, we demonstrate that transcription factor (TF) nuclear mobility determines burst duration, whereas its bound fraction determines burst frequency. Using 3D tracking of TSs, we directly correlate TF binding and RNA synthesis at a specific promoter. Finally, we uncover a striking co-bursting pattern between TSs located at proximal and distal positions in the nucleus. Together, our data reveal a dynamic interplay between TF mobility and RNA bursting that is responsive to stimuli strength, type, modality, and duration.'
