  description: 'Exposure to MHC-antigen complexes on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs) activates T cells, inducing the formation of the immune synapse (IS). Antigen detection at the APC surface is thus a critical step in the adaptive immune response. The physical properties of antigen presenting surfaces encountered by T cells in vivo are believed to modulate T cell activation and proliferation. Although stiffness and ligand mobility influence IS formation, the effect of the complex topography of the APC surface on this process is not well understood. Here, we investigate how nanotopography modulates cytoskeletal dynamics and signaling during the early stages of T cell activation using high-resolution fluorescence microscopy on nanofabricated surfaces with parallel nanoridges of different spacings. We find that although nanoridges reduce the maximum spread area as compared to cells on flat surfaces, the ridges enhance the accumulation of actin and the signaling kinase ZAP-70 at the IS. Actin polymerization is more dynamic in the presence of ridges, which influence the directionality of both actin flows and microtubule growth. Our results demonstrate that the topography of the activating surface exerts both global effects on T cell morphology and local changes in actin and microtubule dynamics, collectively influencing T cell signaling.'

  description: 'Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play an integral role in the adaptive immune response by killing infected cells. Antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells, present pathogenic peptides to the T cell receptor on the CTL surface and co-stimulatory signals required for complete activation. Activated CTLs secrete lytic granules containing enzymes that trigger target cell death at the CTL-target contact, also known as the immune synapse (IS). The actin and microtubule cytoskeletons are instrumental in the killing of CTL targets. Lytic granules are transported along microtubules to the IS, where granule secretion is facilitated by actin depletion and recovery. Furthermore, actomyosin contractility promotes target cell death by mediating mechanical force exertion at the IS. Recent studies have shown that inflammatory cytokines produced by APCs, such as interleukin-12 (IL-12), act as a third signal for CTL activation and enhance CTL proliferation and effector function. However, the biophysical mechanisms mediating such enhanced effector function remain unclear. We hypothesized that the third signal for CTL activation, IL-12, modulates cytoskeletal dynamics and force exertion at the IS, thus potentiating CTL effector function. Here, we used live cell total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to study actomyosin and microtubule dynamics at the IS of murine primary CTLs activated in the presence of peptide-MHC and co-stimulation alone (two signals), or additionally with IL-12 (three signals). We found that three signal-activated CTLs have altered actin flows, myosin dynamics and microtubule growth rates as compared to two signal-activated CTLs. We further showed that lytic granules in three-signal activated CTLs are less clustered and have lower velocities than in two-signal activated CTLs. Finally, we used traction force microscopy to show that three signal-activated CTLs exert greater traction forces than two signal-activated CTLs. Our results demonstrate that activation of CTLs in the presence of IL-12 leads to differential modulation of the cytoskeleton, thereby augmenting the mechanical response of CTLs to their targets. This indicates a potential physical mechanism via which the third signal can enhance the CTL response.'

  description: 'The cohesin complex is central to chromatin looping, but mechanisms by which these long-range chromatin interactions are formed and persist remain unclear. We demonstrate that interactions between a transcription factor (TF) and the cohesin loader NIPBL regulate enhancer-dependent gene activity. Using mass spectrometry, genome mapping, and single-molecule tracking methods, we demonstrate that the glucocorticoid (GC) receptor (GR) interacts with NIPBL and the cohesin complex at the chromatin level, promoting loop extrusion and long-range gene regulation. Real-time single-molecule experiments show that loss of cohesin markedly diminishes the concentration of TF molecules at specific nuclear confinement sites, increasing TF local concentration and promoting gene regulation. Last, patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia cells harboring cohesin mutations exhibit a reduced response to GCs, suggesting that the GR-NIPBL-cohesin interaction is defective in these patients, resulting in poor response to GC treatment.'

  description: 'Confocal microscopy remains a major workhorse in biomedical optical microscopy owing to its reliability and flexibility in imaging various samples, but suffers from substantial point spread function anisotropy, diffraction-limited resolution, depth-dependent degradation in scattering samples and volumetric bleaching2. Here we address these problems, enhancing confocal microscopy performance from the sub-micrometre to millimetre spatial scale and the millisecond to hour temporal scale, improving both lateral and axial resolution more than twofold while simultaneously reducing phototoxicity. We achieve these gains using an integrated, four-pronged approach: (1) developing compact line scanners that enable sensitive, rapid, diffraction-limited imaging over large areas; (2) combining line-scanning with multiview imaging, developing reconstruction algorithms that improve resolution isotropy and recover signal otherwise lost to scattering; (3) adapting techniques from structured illumination microscopy, achieving super-resolution imaging in densely labelled, thick samples; (4) synergizing deep learning with these advances, further improving imaging speed, resolution and duration. We demonstrate these capabilities on more than 20 distinct fixed and live samples, including protein distributions in single cells; nuclei and developing neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, larvae and adults; myoblasts in imaginal disks of Drosophila wings; and mouse renal, oesophageal, cardiac and brain tissues.'

  description: 'B-cells undergo somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation in germinal centers. Somatic hypermutated germinal center B-cells (GCBs) compete to engage with and capture antigens on follicular dendritic cells. Recent studies show that when encountering membrane antigens, GCBs generate actin-rich pod-like structures with B-cell receptor (BCR) microclusters to facilitate affinity discrimination. While deficiencies in actin regulators, including the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp), cause B-cell affinity maturation defects, the mechanism by which actin regulates BCR signaling in GBCs is not fully understood. Using WASp knockout (WKO) mice that express Lifeact-GFP and live-cell total internal reflection fluorescence imaging, this study examined the role of WASp-mediated branched actin polymerization in the GCB immunological synapse. After rapid spreading on antigen-coated planar lipid bilayers, GCBs formed microclusters of phosphorylated BCRs and proximal signaling molecules at the center and the outer edge of the contact zone. The centralized signaling clusters localized at actin-rich GCB membrane protrusions. WKO reduced the centralized micro-signaling clusters by decreasing the number and stability of F-actin foci supporting GCB membrane protrusions. The actin structures that support the spreading membrane also appeared less frequently and regularly in WKO than in WT GCBs, which led to reductions in both the level and rate of GCB spreading and antigen gathering. Our results reveal essential roles for WASp in the generation and maintenance of unique structures for GCB immunological synapses.'

Dynamic compartmentalization of transcription factors and coactivators by such phase-separated condensates regulates the assembly of transcriptional machinery at genomic loci. Although rapid advances in microscopy have demonstrated the ubiquity of such condensates, a rigorous characterization of the physics of phase separation in transcription remains to be carried out. In this review, we discuss theoretical and experimental evidence for biomolecular condensates as dynamic regulators of transcription. Looking beyond, we highlight functional consequences for transcription factor dynamics and gene expression and discuss potential pitfalls of misclassifying biomolecular condensates as liquid droplets in the absence of a rigorous physical description.'

  description: 'Activation of T cells leads to the formation of the immunological synapse (IS) with antigen presenting cells. This requires T cell polarization and coordination between the actomyosin and microtubule cytoskeletons. The interactions between these two cytoskeletal components during T cell activation are not well understood. Here, we elucidate the interactions between microtubules and actin at the IS with high-resolution fluorescence microscopy. We show that microtubule growth dynamics in the peripheral actin-rich region are distinct from those in the central actin-free region. We further demonstrate that these differences arise from differential involvement of Arp2/3- and formin-nucleated actin structures. Formin inhibition results in a moderate decrease in microtubule growth rates, which is amplified in the presence of integrin engagement. In contrast, Arp2/3 inhibition leads to an increase in microtubule growth rates. We find that microtubule filaments are more deformed and exhibit greater shape fluctuations in the periphery of the IS compared to the center. Using small molecule inhibitors, we show that actin dynamics and actomyosin contractility play key roles in defining microtubule deformations and shape fluctuations. Our results indicate a mechanical coupling between the actomyosin and microtubule systems during T cell activation, whereby different actin structures influence microtubule dynamics in distinct ways.

  description: 'When B cells are exposed to antigens, they use their B cell receptors (BCRs) to transduce this external signal into internal signaling cascades and uptake antigen, which activate transcriptional programs. Signaling activation requires complex cytoskeletal remodeling initiated by BCR signaling. The actin cytoskeletal remodeling drives B cell morphological changes, such as spreading, protrusion, contraction, and endocytosis of antigen by mechanical forces, which in turn affect BCR signaling. Therefore, the relationship between the actin cytoskeleton and BCR signaling is a two-way feedback loop. These morphological changes represent the indirect ways by which the actin cytoskeleton regulates BCR signaling. Recent studies using high spatiotemporal resolution microscopy techniques have revealed that actin also can directly influence BCR signaling. Cortical actin networks directly affect BCR mobility, not only during the resting stage by serving as diffusion barriers, but also at its activation stage by altering BCR diffusivity through enhanced actin flow velocities. Furthermore, the actin cytoskeleton along with myosin enable B cells to sense the physical properties of its environment and generate and transmit forces through the BCR. Consequently, the actin cytoskeleton modulates the signaling threshold of BCR to antigenic stimulation. This review discusses the latest research on the relationship between BCR signaling and actin remodeling, and the research techniques. Exploration of the role of actin in BCR signaling will expand the fundamental understanding of the relationship between cell signaling and the cytoskeleton and the mechanisms underlying cytoskeleton related immune disorders and cancer.'

First we modify RCAN to handle image volumes, showing that our network enables denoising competitive with three other state-of-the-art neural networks. We use RCAN to restore noisy four-dimensional super-resolution data, enabling image capture of over tens of thousands of images (thousands of volumes) without apparent photobleaching. Second, using simulations we show that RCAN enables resolution enhancement equivalent to, or better than, other networks. Third, we exploit RCAN for denoising and resolution improvement in confocal microscopy, enabling ~2.5-fold lateral resolution enhancement using stimulated emission depletion microscopy ground truth. Fourth, we develop methods to improve spatial resolution in structured illumination microscopy using expansion microscopy data as ground truth, achieving improvements of ~1.9-fold laterally and ~3.6-fold axially. Finally, we characterize the limits of denoising and resolution enhancement, suggesting practical benchmarks for evaluation and further enhancement of network performance.'

  description: 'Single-molecule tracking (SMT) allows the study of transcription factor (TF) dynamics in the nucleus, giving important information regarding the diffusion and binding behavior of these proteins in the nuclear environment. Dwell time distributions obtained by SMT for most TFs appear to follow bi-exponential behavior. This has been ascribed to two discrete populations of TFs—one non-specifically bound to chromatin and another specifically bound to target sites, as implied by decades of biochemical studies. However, emerging studies suggest alternate models for dwell-time distributions, indicating the existence of more than two populations of TFs (multi-exponential distribution), or even the absence of discrete states altogether (power-law distribution). Here, we present an analytical pipeline to evaluate which model best explains SMT data. We find that a broad spectrum of TFs (including glucocorticoid receptor, oestrogen receptor, FOXA1, CTCF) follow a power-law distribution of dwell-times, blurring the temporal line between non-specific and specific binding, suggesting that productive binding may involve longer binding events than previously believed. From these observations, we propose a continuum of affinities model to explain TF dynamics, that is consistent with complex interactions of TFs with multiple nuclear domains as well as binding and searching on the chromatin template.'

  description: 'Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by binding to specific consensus motifs within the local chromatin context. The mechanisms by which TFs navigate the nuclear environment as they search for binding sites remain unclear. Here, we used single-molecule tracking and machine-learning-based classification to directly measure the nuclear mobility of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in live cells. We revealed two distinct and dynamic low-mobility populations. One accounts for specific binding to chromatin, while the other represents a confinement state that requires an intrinsically disordered region (IDR), implicated in liquid-liquid condensate subdomains. Further analysis showed that the dwell times of both subpopulations follow a power-law distribution, consistent with a broad distribution of affinities on the GR cistrome and interactome. Together, our data link IDRs with a confinement state that is functionally distinct from specific chromatin binding and modulates the transcriptional output by increasing the local concentration of TFs at specific sites.'

Constitutive loss or acute inhibition of the Arp2/3 regulator, N-WASP, which is associated with enhanced signaling, increases the proportion of BCR trajectories with lower diffusivity. Furthermore, loss of N-WASP reduces the diffusivity of CD19, a stimulatory co-receptor, but not that of FcγRIIB, an inhibitory co-receptor.

  description: 'T-cell receptor (TCR) triggering and subsequent T-cell activation are essential for the adaptive immune response. Recently, multiple lines of evidence have shown that force transduction across the TCR complex is involved during TCR triggering, and that the T cell might use its force-generation machinery to probe the mechanical properties of the opposing antigen-presenting cell, giving rise to different signaling and physiological responses. Mechanistically, actin polymerization and turnover have been shown to be essential for force generation by T cells, but how these actin dynamics are regulated spatiotemporally remains poorly understood. Here, we report that traction forces generated by T cells are regulated by dynamic microtubules (MTs) at the interface. These MTs suppress Rho activation, nonmuscle myosin II bipolar filament assembly, and actin retrograde flow at the T-cell-substrate interface. Our results suggest a novel role of the MT cytoskeleton in regulating force generation during T-cell activation.'

  description: 'B-cell signaling activation is most effectively triggered by the binding of B-cell receptors (BCRs) to membrane-bound antigens. In vivo, B-cells encounter antigen on antigen-presenting cells (APC), which possess complex surfaces with convoluted topographies, a fluid membrane and deformable cell bodies. However, whether and how the physical properties of antigen presentation affect B-cell activation is not well understood. Here we use nanotopographic surfaces that allow systematic variation of geometric parameters to show that surface features on a subcellular scale influence B-cell signaling and actin dynamics. Parallel nanoridges with spacings of 3 microns or greater induce actin intensity oscillations on the ventral cell surface. Nanotopography-induced actin dynamics requires BCR signaling, actin polymerization, and myosin contractility. The topography of the stimulatory surface also modulates the distribution of BCR clusters in activated B-cells. Finally, B-cells stimulated on nanopatterned surfaces exhibit intracellular calcium oscillations with frequencies that depend on topography. Our results point to the importance of physical aspects of ligand presentation, in particular, nanotopography for B-cell activation and antigen gathering.'

  description: 'T cell responses to antigen are initiated by engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR)1, leading to activation of diverse signaling cascades, including an incompletely defined pathway that triggers rapid remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. Defects in the control of actin dynamics and organization are associated with several human immunodeficiency diseases, emphasizing the importance of cytoskeletal remodeling in the functioning of the adaptive immune system. Here, we investigate the role of the adaptor protein Bcl102 in the control of actin dynamics. Although Bcl10 is primarily known as a component of the pathway connecting the TCR to activation of the NF-κB3 transcription factor, a few studies have implicated Bcl10 in antigen receptor-dependent control of actin polymerization and F-actin-dependent functional responses. However, the role of Bcl10 in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics remains largely undefined. To investigate the contribution of Bcl10 in the regulation of TCR-dependent cytoskeletal dynamics, we monitored actin dynamics at the immune synapse of primary murine CD8 effector T cells. Quantification of these dynamics reveals two distinct temporal phases distinguished by differences in speed and directionality. Our results indicate that effector CD8 T cells lacking Bcl10 display faster actin flows and more dynamic lamellipodia, compared to wild-type cells. These studies define a role for Bcl10 in TCR-dependent actin dynamics, emphasizing that Bcl10 has important cytoskeleton-directed functions that are likely independent of its role in transmission of NF-κB -activating signals.'

Although many physiological signals, including glucocorticoid hormones, are pulsatile, the effects of transient stimulation on bursting are unknown. Here we characterize RNA synthesis from single-copy glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-regulated transcription sites (TSs) under pulsed (ultradian) and constant hormone stimulation. In contrast to constant stimulation, pulsed stimulation induces restricted bursting centered around the hormonal pulse. Moreover, we demonstrate that transcription factor (TF) nuclear mobility determines burst duration, whereas its bound fraction determines burst frequency. Using 3D tracking of TSs, we directly correlate TF binding and RNA synthesis at a specific promoter. Finally, we uncover a striking co-bursting pattern between TSs located at proximal and distal positions in the nucleus. Together, our data reveal a dynamic interplay between TF mobility and RNA bursting that is responsive to stimuli strength, type, modality, and duration.'
