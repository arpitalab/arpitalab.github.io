        The <b>Upadhyaya Lab</b> aims to understand how cellular mechanics and cytoskeletal forces enable a cell to sense and respond to its physical environment. We are particularly interested in the mechanical regulation of biochemical signaling in cells during the immune response, cancer and development. We combine quantitative imaging, computational analysis and approaches from soft condensed matter with genetic manipulation and modern cell biology to uncover how cellular forces are linked with signal transduction and gene expression.

        We are <b>looking</b> for motivated graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to join the team! Interested trainees should <a href="mailto:arpitau@umd.edu">contact Arpita</a> to talk about potential projects.
