title: Arpita is awarded an NIGMS Maximizing Investigator's Research Award (MIRA)
subtitle: MIRA
tags: [Grants, NIH, NIGMS]

Arpita receives a MIRA  from the National Institutes of Health, National Institute for General Medical Sciences (NIGMS). This program "provides support for the research in an investigator's laboratory that falls within the mission of NIGMS. The goal of MIRA is to increase the efficiency of NIGMS funding by providing investigators with greater stability and flexibility, thereby enhancing scientific productivity and the chances for important breakthroughs."  Arpita plans to continue the work on cytoskeletal dynamics and mechanobiology of immune cells and expand the collaboration with the Hager Lab to study the mechanobiology of transcription factor dynamics and gene expression. We will be setting up HILO imaging in the lab to study single molecule dynamics of nuclear hormone receptors and other transcription factors. Looking for postdoctoral fellows to join this exciting project!
