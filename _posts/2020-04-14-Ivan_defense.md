Ivan gave a fantastic talk in a successful defense of his PhD thesis! The first student from the
lab (and perhaps all of UMD) to have defended virtually -- it was very well attended
and a bonus to have his family, friends and collaborators join from afar. It was the culmination of years of work.
No cake and champagne but always time for a virtual lab happy hour!

Read some of his work in [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14335-8)
and in [Molecular Biology of the Cell]()
