Arpita receives a Transitions to Excellence Award from the National Science Foundation's Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences. This program helps established 
researchers to expand or make a transition in their research programs via a sabbatical leave or similar mechanism of professional development and then develop that 
research program in their own lab. This award will also enable the PI to acquire new scientific or technical expertise. Arpita plans to extend the collaboration with the Hager 
Lab to study the mechanobiology of transcription factor dynamics and gene expression.
