David gave a fantastic talk in a successful defense of his PhD thesis! The second student from the
lab to have defended virtually -- it was very well attended
and a bonus to have his family, friends and collaborators join from afar. No cake and
champagne but we got together for a virtual lab happy hour!
It was the culmination of years of work in an exciting new area we started a collaboration
on with the Hager lab at NIH, with two recent publications!
in [Nucleic Acids Research](http://markdowntutorial.com/)
and in [Molecular Cell](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1097276521000137?via%3Dihub)
